Governor Carney Requires Delawareans to Wear Face Coverings in Public Settings. AUGUST 24, 2020 UPDATE: As Delaware families consider a safe return to school, Governor Carney and the Division of Public Health announced an update to Delaware’s face coverings guidance for children. All children who are in kindergarten or older must wear face coverings in public settings, including school buildings, according to the updated DPH guidance. All children 2 years of age and older are strongly encouraged to wear face coverings in public. Children younger than 2 must not wear face coverings due to suffocation risk. A child with a medical condition that makes it hard to breathe or a disability that prevents the child from wearing a face covering is not required to wear one.</a></td>

David Ige has signed a 17th COVID-19 emergency proclamation reducing the state’s mandatory self-quarantine period for travelers entering the state and traveling between counties from 14 to 10 days. The new policy took effect December 16. The change is based on this month’s updated recommendations issued by the CDC and the DOH. Previously, Gov. David Ige announced he will delay the launch of the pre-travel testing program for incoming travelers to Hawai‘i. The program is now scheduled to begin on Oct. 1. This means all travelers entering the State of Hawai‘i will be subject to the mandatory 14-day quarantine until Oct. 1, when the pre-travel testing program is scheduled to begin. Also, the state has created the Enhanced Movement Quarantine (EMQ), to be established by each individual county, that provides residents and visitors the ability to spend time on other islands without being in 14-day traveler quarantine. On August 6, Gov. Ige announced that the inter-island travel quarantine will be reinstated, in part, on Tuesday, Aug. 11. The State of Hawaii announced that the new online Safe Travels application will be mandatory for all travelers on Sept. 1.Gov. David Ige announced plans for a Hawai‘i pre-travel testing program that gives travelers the option of possibly avoiding 14-day-long quarantine upon arrival to the state, beginnig October 15. Details of the pre-travel testing program are outlined in the 14th emergency proclamation. It allows the mandatory 14-day quarantine to continue, with the exception of the pre-travel test option. Starting on Nov. 24, travelers wishing to bypass the 14-day mandatory quarantine must have their COVID-19 test results – from a trusted testing partner – prior to departure for the State of Hawaiʻi.</a></td>
